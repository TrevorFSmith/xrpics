These photos of VR/AR/XR/MR hardware are for anyone to use for any purpose, with or without attribution.

A credit to "Trevor F. Smith" and a link back to [https://trevor.smith.name/](https://trevor.smith.name/) would be nice, but isn't required. Follow your heart!

Also, check out [Spacibl≈ç](https://spaciblo.org/), an open stack for multi-user WebVR spaces. It's sort of like Wordpress, but for VR instead of blogs.

Handy links to the gamepad maps:
